CDN Implementation
CDN is a Content Delivery Network. That means the CDN is a cache mechanism and is mostly useful for customers that have applications with a lot of static content. A good example of applications that have a lot of static content are Mobile Applications. 
These applications have a lot of css, js, jpeg and other files that are static, meaning that they only change after a push of a new version of the application.
With a CDN on your infrastructure those files will be presented to the end-users by CDN instead of the Front-end servers. This will remove load from your servers and in this way you can save hardware resources and have a better performance.
With a CDN the hydration process will be served on CDN instead of Front-End Servers and this will prevent outages and the need for hardware scale-up.
Configuration
The following configurations are considered relevant on the CDN side in order to take advantage of its benefits for OS apps:
Add an Alias canonical name (CNAME) resource record in DNS 
Configure an additional CNAME in DNS with the same URL that is showing up on the Environment Hostname (Service Center Administration tab)
App Certificate in CDN
To ensure a secure connection, the certificate used by the apps that will be served by the CDN needs to be installed on the CDN
If more than one certificate is used (for different apps) then more than one CDN needs to be configured
Define the HTTP versions (supported by OS) that the CDN will use
HTTP/2; HTTP/1.1; HTTP/1.0
CDN should deliver the requests to Load Balancer
The origin domain name and path should be the Load Balancer address
Donâ€™t use ForwardCookies
This means that the CDN will not cache the object based on a cookie sent by the viewer
Redirect to HTTPS always
When accessing the url via HTTP, the CDN will redirect to HTTPS
Setting up OriginKeepaliveTimeout to 60 sec
This is the time that CDN will maintain an idle connection before timeout with the origin
Setting up OriginReadTimeout to 30 sec
This is the amount of time that CDN will wait for a response from origin
